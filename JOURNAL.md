## 11/6/2025 - Started with the Schematic  

Today I started with the schematic. I know I had chosen ESP32-C5 Module. But it was not available on LCSC and JLCPCB, so I decided to go with an ESP32-C6 (no 5GHz). I added the parts that are confirmed for now. I think this project is gonna be fun to route.
